Huge war were waged between the different new sentients species of animals and what remains are 6 tribes that have took over as the new dominant species.
### [[The Black Feather]]
Mainly Composed of evolved bird of the Corvian family (crows & raven). They are with the undergrounder the most intelligent tribe of the ship. 
They have developped agriculture and democraty, they know how to build shelter, use shields from the weapon humans left. They have developped their own kind of weapons fitted to their claws.
They know very basic healthcare and medical plants.
### [[The Undergrounder]]
Solely composed of oversized and higlhy intelligent Rats. They are the most technologically advanced tribe, being the only one with the advantages of having hands with opposable thumbs.
They are territorial but inclined to trade, have learned agriculture and how to raise cattle. Their society is a gerontocraty, a council of elder take the decisions.
They know, can and will use weapons human left, sole reason they have not took over the whole ship is lack of munition, aim training, a tendancie for weapon having been left without maiontainance for literal millons of year to break down easily and lack of ambition.
### [[Fly Queen]] & [[Leaf Queen]]
Two similar tribes of bees and ants. They function as one individual, the queen controlling the rest of the colony with pheromon, sounds and radio frequency.
They can't use advanced weapons and are not too advanced in term of warfare tactics but what they lack in quality they make up in quantity. A raid can be constituted of up to thousands of individuals, wich upon death can be replaced almost as fast by the queens.
They mastered the very basics of agriculture but still rely on a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
### [[The Trappers]]
The most human like tribe behind the Undergrounder, they evolved from spider. 6 pairs of arms and 2 legs, a pair of venom fang, silk producing glands in their hands, they have a vast array of martial technique at their disposal and are powerfull foes even alone.
They however hardly form societies, the female usually stay secluded in one place, trapping their sustenance in vast web trap while the men roam the territory, stopping briefly if a female want to mate.
### [[The Roamer]]
Roamer are the smallest and most peacful tribe of the 6. Comrpomised of descendant of beetles, their impressively hard and thick chitineous armor protect them from almost anything. As a result they rarely ever ressort to violence. They however learnt how to use some of the heavy weaponry human left behind and took a nack to mounting them on their back.
They lives in small community, usually 3 or 4 family and roam the ship, living a life of hunter-gatherer.
