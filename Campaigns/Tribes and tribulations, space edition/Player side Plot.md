At the end of the 13 cycle, one of the world ship never came back. It has been searched for for the past 2 cycles. You are in the middle of the 15, on board of the [[Hope]] when you finally stumble upon it.
It doesn't seem to be much damaged, the defense system being the most worn out part.

You are a team of 2-8 commando, trained and equipped to investigate what happened and potentially save whoever might remain of the original crew. After boarding the ship, your first task is to make your way to the power control unit to refuel the [[World-Ships#Black hole generator|Black hole generator]].
You then have to make your way to the otherside of the ship toward the navigation unit, you are equipped with a device that allow distant override of the navigation system. 
Your last task is to try and make sense of the event that transpired in the ship, leading to its dissapearance.
