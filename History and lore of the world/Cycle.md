Cycles represent the periodic migration of the humanity in space. At the end of a cycle, the 7 worlds meet up at a suitable planet to exchange people, informations, technologies and to reignite the bond between the [[Community|Communities]] of the 7 worlds.

After a large and up to several years long gathering called the [[Great reunion]], the communities decide wich area of the universe they want to explore or what activities they want to pursue.

It was deemed important to synchronize the activites of each worlds for several reasons : 
- By moving so close to the speed of light, time is almost frozen in the worlds. If the 7 worlds where to move at different times without coordination, some community would age, wither and die without ever seeing the other ever again.
- It permit a "roll call" of sort, so that if a community is absent it can be looked for and helped.
- Sharing knowledge, technologies and people also help move faster toward [[The Great Goal]] 

Since the begining of the 7 worlds era, 15 cycles have elapsed and the 16th is about to end.
