Worlds are the second mega-structure ever built by humanity (the first being the [[Hyperopolis]]. Inspired by the flagship used in deep space manned mission WL-Omega "Behemoth" serie. They are the largest spaceship ever made.
So far, 7 worlds have been created : [[Hope]], [[Kor'Helios]], [[Wokan'hal]], [[Jyan'Pul]], [[Dragotsennosti]], [[Tutkimusmatkailija]], [[Jĩngyàn]] and no project of an 8th are or were discuted altough it could be done.

### Components
#### Bio-sphere
*Main article : [[Life in Worlds]]*
The first and most important component of a world is a very large biosphere. Complete with ocean, plenty of land mimicking the composition of earth. It was built to house up to a billion human being with room to spare for a rich animal population.

Animals were indeed taken in the worlds for emotionnal support and as emergency food and ressource as a contingency in case humanity have to stay for extended periods of time on a planet without technologie.

Food is made by state-of-the-art [[Food generator]] via cultivation of animals and vegetals cells and 3D printing.

Water is almost totally recycled and with the large quantity of water extracted from earth, the onboard stock can last almost up to the heat death of the universe.
#### Shield and Rings
The worlds are, like any very large astral bodies, subject to a huge amount of small collision when travelling in space and in solar system. To avoid being turned into a beehive, two contingency were put in place :
- **The Rings** : the rings are large thoron orbiting around key part of the ship, namely : around the biosphere, reactor and emergency system. They are meant to attract gravitationally most of the smaller astral bodies that would come into contact with the ship. 
  Equipped with swarms of nanomachines and operated by powerfull AI, they can turn most smaller objects into dust and in otherwise smal enough particle as to not harm the integrity of the hull. 
  This system is ineffective when moving at relativistic speed, the rings are thus disabled when travelling in deep space. being made of nanobots, they can be disassembled and stored under the shield.
- **The shield** : a mist of strange matter particle, kept in supraconductivity state. Magnetically bound to the hull, they over at around a meter of it. Any object larger than a few atoms width will collide with the net that those particle make. 
  The magnetic field that bind the particle cushion the shock, absorbing all the energy and safely redistributing it to the world's network.
  Even when moving at relativistic shield (and thanks to the IA for plotting the best course possible), it is extremely rare that particle will actually lend on the hull. When it does happen it can disturb the shield integrity pretty badly but the repair are thankfully simple.

Thanks to those systems, hull repair was only needed 5 times in the almost 16 cycles that already elapsed.
#### Black hole generator
The worlds enormous scale need an equally enormous amount of power. Fortunately, thanks to [[strange matter]], black hole technologies were developped. The core reactor of each world consist of a spinning, electrically charged black hole of relatively small mass. The energy is not extracted by hooking up a dynamo around it (it would be equivalent to burning uranium in a coal plant) but rather by using the Jupiter's effect. Electrons are fed into a strange matter crystal net around the black hole, it's spin make them go faster, *relativistically faster*, esentially transfering a smal part of the black hole energy to them. Due to the nature of the interaction, the energy is not taken on the black hole spinning momentum or electrical energy but rather on it's mass.
With the ratio $E = mc^2$, gigantic amount of energy can be extracted from a black hole and it's easy to replenish it, simply feed it heavy materials.

The black hole in itself is stabilised by it's rotation (wich prevent it from growing or shrinking too much), and the rotation is controlled by it's electrical field. The later also allow it to be magnetically bound to the worlds and to regulate the gravity well it forms.

Spinning black hole already have sharp gravity well (there horizon of event is very close to their surface), electrical stabilization make it go from a well to a straight line.
#### Weapons
Worlds were not meant to be combat ship but nontheless equipped with heavy weaponry, just in case.
Mainly two types of weapons can be found : railgun and light cannons. It is also equipped with nuclear space-to-space and space-to-ground missile launcher, relativistic bomb and as a last ressort the core can be made into a black hole bomb.
- **Railgun** : railgun are in essence cannon. Only instead of gunpowder, they use magnetism to accelerate projectile. Projectiles range from traditionnal steel sphere to exotic anti-matter slug. A very wide range of object can be used as long as they are magnetic.
- **Light cannons** : like railgun, light cannons are essentially traditionnal weapon on steroïd. Picture a TW laser and the damage it can do to target at several light seconds. Now ramp that up two order of magnitude and you've got the light cannon.
- **Nuclear missile** : old fashionned nuclear missile with rocket fuel propulsion added in the case of space-to-ground shot. Sometimes simple is best.
- **Relativistic bomb** : maybe the most creative weapon on the worlds. Each is equipped with one launcher that can propulse a weight at speed only a pico percent ($10^{-12}$)   appart from the light speed, wich is by far faster than even the fastest speed atteignable by a world. At this speed, even a light weight like a bullet would cause immense destruction, piercing through world's shield like a hot knife through butter... and create all kind of exciting new states of matter on the way.
- **Black hole bomb** : in the end, weapon are just tools to relay some kinds of energy from point A to point B with destructive intent. BHB are not much more complicated. By destabilizing the core of a worlds (both by stopping it's rotation and transforming it's mass as energy), it will be made to explode like anny end-of-life black hole would do.
  The ensuing catastrophic event is on a too large scale to be called an explosion, it would be a true supernova. Blowing away the ship and everything in a radius of several lightyear.
  Activating it would lead to the death of the whole [[Community]], nothing has nor can be made to avoid the destruction. Fortunately that's a fate nobody experienced... yet.
