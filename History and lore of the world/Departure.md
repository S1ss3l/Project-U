...And they built the first ship wich name mean [[Hope]]. With that one they traveled the solar system and constructed 6 other ship, enough to host all of humanity. Those ships were called [[World-Ships]], for they were not planet but home nontheless.
Their name is : [[Kor'Helios]], [[Wokan'hal]], [[Jyan'Pul]], [[Dragotsennosti]], [[Tutkimusmatkailija]], [[Jĩngyàn]]. 3 named after the heros of the first world, 3 named after what they all symbolised.

The exact date was lost from history when we traded the old time system to the new coordinated one, but it was around the beginning of the old year that humanity collectively boarded the ship. Of course many remained on the old earth, what happened to them is not known. A pact was made so that each civilisation would leave each other alone, regardless of the outcome for either. We wished them the best and mourned for we never saw thm again.

Around a billion humans stayed on earth and around 11 left the earth. It took around 6 month for most of the population to board and around 6 more to finish the preparations.

The 7 world departed, coordinated their course and set sail toward the unknown darkness of deep space. 
The first [[Cycle]] was only a test run to see how each ship would hold in real conditions. Some world passed perfectly while [[The great pandemic|some others]] [[The mad war| ran]] [[The stranded ship incident|into]] [[The great mutiny|troubles]] along the way. 
They all passed that first test however it was clear that the weakest link (the human) needed to change to survive the journey. The first planet choosen for the[[Great reunion]] beared heavy ressemblance to the old earth, maybe it was homesickness that guided that decision.

The human that first boarded the ship knew they were gonna work toward a [[The Great Goal|goal]] that would be bigger than all of them. They had already conquered their own physical limitation, they had to overcome their psycological ones. And to achieve this, 4 methods were tested : [[The new generation]], [[The Steel brotherhood]], [[Absurdism]] and [[The return to nature]]. 
They yielded different result but made it possible to hope for much better results in the next cycles. After 3 century and a much larger population than before, they once again boarded the worlds.

As eons had passed since their first departure, again, for the second cycle of a long series, the 7 world set their course toward the unknown.
