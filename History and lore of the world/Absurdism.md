*To learn more about how Absurdism was first put in place at the end of the first cycle, see : [[How your grandpa became the symbol of badass]]*

The absurdism methode was later named that way because it stem from a contradiction, how can we make sure that no infighting happen while enforcing true cooperation ? The absurd answer : by making people fight. The worst part is that it worked so well, it became the mainstream.

Different scenario were tested but the one that worked the best was as follow : 
People were separated in 3 groups : the scientist, the navigator and the planetary team.
- The scientist are the group to be taken care of, the 2 other are here to allow them to do their job in the most efficient way possible.
- The planetary team do all the dirty work of exploring planet, fighting aliens threat and bringing back samples for the science team. It's the hardest and riskiest job but they also work the least out of the 3 groups. They are also the most privilegied, and can spend their time however they want between missions. Later, people in this group ended up being mostly artist, using the free time to be creative. They are also scientifically trained. For their work, qualification and accomplishment, the planetary team member are regarded as hero and the position as an honor.
- The navigator are an in-between, they have the highest responsabilities of the 3 groups, making sure they stay in sync with the other world-ship are their most important task. They also arbitrate between the 2 other team as to wich planet to explore and witch to not. 

The repartition in 3 groups is but one side of the coin. For this dynamic to work another important element was put in place : separating the groups. They essentially have no physical contact at all between cycles. Leaders of the 3 groups can talk to each other but they all live in distinct and non communicative part of the world-ship.

They also all have access to one key part of the ship, the navigator obviously control the navigation system, the planetary team hold the life support system and the scientist control the black hole battery.

From this organisation emerge a system where everybody hold everyone hostage. Of course this is just the ultimate contingency, hostility between the groups is highly discouraged and people are taught to look after each other. 

Generally it stops there but there have been time where it really ended up being a hostage situation. Because of it, no damage was done and the ship managed to complete the cycle.

At the end of the cycle, people are free to join any of the team, stay in the one they were in or try to be enrolled in one of the other 3 world-ship of the [[Backbone alliance]]. The hiring process is supervised by the 3 leaders for their respective team, they then resign and election take place in the team to elect a new leader or set of leader (there have been council of up to 200 leader in some cycles for the scientist team).
