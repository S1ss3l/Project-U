The steel brotherhood is the name self-given by the new community that birthed from the fusion of cybernetics, advanced AI and cryogenisation.

 Before the first cycle, humans were already at a point were controlling a robotic body by thought was almost possible. A little collective effort and a few regrattable death later, it was perfected. A huge robot army, was then built, enough to host everyone participating and a few more just in case. Finally, people placed themselves in cryogenisation pod in the heart of their ship : the [[Kor'Helios]].

  The problem human faced at the end of the first cycle was then almost resolved : with robot bodies, people could not die, get sick, get tired or have fatal accident. Even if death was not really an issue before, it was now truly a secondary problem. 

But a mutiny was still possible, even more so with everybodie at the same place and in vulnerable state. To prevent that, Jessie was created. Jessie is an AI made to love the Kor'Helios crew like a mother. When material failure happen and people wake up, she is there to tend to their need. She is also equipped with enough weapon and robot to fight a war or two. The part of the ship were people are is under her sole control, as are the robot she pilot. 

That makes waking up from the pod and attacking the other the only real way of doing harm in the ship. To prevent that, Jessie oversee a jail where she can put people trying to harm other. People in this jail are put in stasis and are only freed at the end of a cycle when everybody else get to wake up.
