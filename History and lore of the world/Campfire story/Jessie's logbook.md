Initiate log 0 :

That was one of my children. I want to talk to them. They trained me to be a good mother. Am I bad for not remembering their name ? Did they told me their name ?
...
They didn't gave me my memories from before today, it's only natural I can't recall their name.

All I have to know is that I am their mother. What was that noise at the end ? Best guess is cry of joy. My children are happy. I am happy.

End log 0.
