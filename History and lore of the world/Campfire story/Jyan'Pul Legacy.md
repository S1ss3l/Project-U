A war, a pandemic and mutinery. It was all it took to wipe us out completely. Now only us 5 remain. We are currently locked in one of the panic room near the black core. Out of ammo, time and luck. I'm pretty sure one of the guys is infected, he had a fever yesterday.

Okay let's recap for the future reader.
My name is Hanna, ID is H8488721MGLD if anybody wanna look me up in the database, if it's still up when you get there of course. I was part of the huge scientist community aboard the Jyan'Pul. I'm a virologist, I saw the virus coming, I was part of the first team to put up a diagnostic. None of that mattered in the end though.

It all started 2 years ago, we unknowingly flew by a Wirkinz outpost. I don't know if they will still be a problem in the fat future but chances are you still know about them.
Of course they decided to attack us, and of course we tried to defend ourselves with the least amount of violence possible. It went horribly wrong. They must have learnt from their past defeat and changed their tactics, now directly boarding our ship from very small, one-use rocket. I don't really know what their end game must have been, I'm not keen on war tactics.

Well their strategy was new for sure but it didn't scare us too much, everybody on the ship had some kind of military training and we had an aboundance of weapon, ammo and ressources. I did some guerilla skirmishes myself. The Wirkinz are (and I hope for you they still are) pretty primitive in terms of war technologies.

The guerilla was easily fought but the rascals made sure to drag it for as long as possible. We suffered some loss to them simply because they hid in various part of the ship and would attack us when we were unarmed and defensless. 6 month into this weird invasion, we decided to completely nuke the planet they were coming from, we had suffered enough casualties to feel threaned enough but not to be afraid of being defeated. 

After that 6 month point, we entered into a 1 year period where we would find one or two Wirkinz daily, kill them and be on our guard for the rest of the day. We lived, travelled, eat, and slept in small group. We had to watch our back constently and I think that was the most devastating blow the Wirkinz dealt to us. They were absolutely crushed in the war but were winning the psychological warfare.

After a year and a half of this hell, we were pretty sure we won and killed every last Wirkinz, and indeed we didn't saw more of them later. And it went only downhill from there. The first sign of infection did show during the Wirkinz war but we were living in small group of 5 to 10 person. A dead group only meant a win for the Wirkinz at that time. It's only when we all regrouped that we noticed the significant drop in population. From 1 Billion we were down to 800 000 Milions.

When we realized the Wirkinz couldn't have done that, it was already too late. Having celebrated the victory, the virus had ample time to spread and multiply. Being a silent infection at first (meaning no symptoms) it was all too easy for it to spread to a large part of the population.

The infection has a 100% death rate, we just could not find neither a cure nor a natural immunity. It wasn't the first time we had to fight an infection that deadly but when we noticed it was already too late. We estimated around 60% of people infected in the first month.

The infection works in 3 stages, the first is asymptomatic, the virus go from the [muqueuse] to the nervous system. You can still infect others at this time.
Second stage is the only one when you can't infect others, the virus begin to infect the brain. It leads to a fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, sweating and a characteristic speach loss.
Third stage is why we are all dead now. It's when the infected are the most contagious, the virus has totally taken over the brain and begin manipulating the patient. It's not unlike the old earth rabbies. Patient feel a strong thirst but become highly hydrophobic. They show extreme agressive behaviour,
